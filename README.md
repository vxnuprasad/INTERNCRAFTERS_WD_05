# SKYSCOPE ( Weather Web Application )

This **Weather Web Application** fetches real-time weather data using a weather API. It allows users to view current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant details based on either the user's location (via geolocation) or a manually inputted location. Additionally, it displays the current date and time of the location and shows a graphical icon representing the climate condition (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).

4. **Date and Time Display:**
   - Shows the current date and time for the entered location, formatted appropriately.
   
5. **Graphic Icon for Weather Conditions:**
   - Displays an icon that visually represents the current weather condition (such as a sun for sunny, cloud for cloudy, etc.).
   
6. **User-Friendly Interface:**
